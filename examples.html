          <p>
            “Men's Talk” is about a woman who sings her frustration at her lover
            for not opening up with her but instead discussing with his male
            friends. This indirect commentary alludes to the current exclusion
            of women from traditionally masucline spheres, such as business and
            politics. In these political songs, due to the beidong 被动
            (passive) and vulnerable portrayals of women, the woman often
            represents the “powerless people” whereas the man often represents
            the “oppressive government”, allowing men to further identity with
            the feminine voices. Thus, Mandopop's gender portrayals are
            remarkably nuanced in that while they reinforce conservative gender
            roles, they also subvert then by allowing both men and women to
            identify with the women, allowing for women's roles to become more
            relatable and appreciated by both genders and a different
            perspective for male listeners.

            “Because of you, I am blown by a cold wind” is told from a female
            perspective and conveys a deep sense of despair and disillusionment
            with her lover. The woman in this song is depicted with
            stereotypical “female” passivity, as noted through her actions of
            crying, waiting, and forgetting – “the tars run from my eyes”. The
            “cold wind” is a metaphor for the emotional coldness of her man,
            alluding to how Taiwanese men can emotionally withdraw from their
            relationships, leaving their partner waiting for them. The woman's
            anger is expressed through her rejection of new suitors and
            condemnation of her friends for not sympathizing her pain, but also
            with an undertone of resignation – “who really cares about
            another?”. Additionally, her tone has underlying hints of
            forgiveness and a hope to “put things in the past.”

            “How can it be?” also conveys heartbreak and despair, but in a much
            more “masculine” manner. The singer's anger is much more clearly
            expressed through singing in louder, indignant tones. Lyrically, the
            song speaks of love “crushing (fensui)” and chasing his lover,
            combined with the themes of unrestrained passion instead of
            resignation. Instead of accepting their relationship's fate, the
            singer takes on a much more aggressive and angry tone. Although
            these two songs are written by the same lyricist Jonathan Lee, the
            expressions, musicality, and lyrics of the songs demonstrate a clear
            difference between the “natural characteristics” of men and women.

            Soon the leaves will fall and the autumn wind will blow<br/>
            It is time to part.<br/>
            Could it be that something caused it to happen?<br/>
            Yes, but without hate or regrets.<br/>
            In the past, few have allowed a man to express himself.<br/>
            Love in reality can be crushed.<br/>
            Because you lose your own love, it makes it hard to understand<br/><br/>
            
            How come<br/>
            Love can go without wanting to go.<br/>
            It goes and I cannot follow.<br/>
            Again I ponder the past.<br/>
            Love can go without wanting to go<br/>
            My world sinks<br/>
            You ignore my sadness.<br/><br/>
            
            How come. How come.<br/>
            How can you forget that warm feeling?<br/>
            How can I believe you will never regret it?<br/>
            How can I believe that you want to take your love away?<br/><br/>
            
            How come Oh! How come<br/>
            How come false sincerity is all I get?<br/>
            If your once sincere heart no longer wants me<br/>
            How come you are crying?<br/><br/>

            “Angel” demonstrates the wenrou 温柔 aspect of Taiwanese
            masculinity. Tao expresses feelings of loneliness and an inability
            to express his feelings towards others, but still is able to convey
            his gentle side: “Who can give me wenrou and embrace me…?”. This
            multi-dimensional aspect on masculinity allows for men to be
            depicted with a wider range of emotional depth, although not as much
            as their women counterparts.

            镜子中 看见一张陌生的脸<br/>
            那眼神如此黯淡<br/>
            笑一笑 只牵动苦涩的嘴角<br/>
            我的寂寞谁知道<br/><br/>
            
            像条船在海上飘<br/>
            北斗星也看不到<br/>
            谁能够扬起了帆<br/>
            远远离开这黑潮<br/><br/>
            
            Angel Angel<br/>
            盼望你在我身边<br/>
            Angel Angel<br/>
            请你 紧紧抓住我的手<br/><br/>
            
            有时候 我想不会有人了解<br/>
            心里面藏着的痛<br/>
            我害怕 用真心面对这世界<br/>
            只好越来越沉默<br/><br/>
            
            一个人(一个人) 在人海漂<br/>
            说话的人找不到<br/>
            谁给我温柔(拥抱我) 拥抱<br/>
            当我感觉心快要碎了<br/><br/>
            
            Angel Angel<br/>
            盼望你在我身边<br/>
            Angel Angel<br/>
            是否 听见我在呼唤你<br/><br/>
            
            能不能 告诉孤单疲惫的我<br/>
            你永远为我守候<br/><br/>
            
            Angel Angel<br/>
            请你留在我的身边<br/>

            In the mirror, I see a stranger's face<br/>
            Have eyes that look so dim/solemn<br/>
            Smile a bit, but only bitterly move the corner of the mouth<br/>
            Who knows my loneliness<br/><br/>
            
            Like a ship fluttering on the sea<br/>
            Cannot even see the big dipper<br/>
            Who can raise the sail<br/>
            to leave this #1(black current) far far away<br/><br/>
            
            Angel Angel<br/>
            Wish that you are by my side<br/>
            Angel Angel<br/>
            (I bet you), hold my hand tightly<br/><br/>
            
            Sometimes, I don't think anyone will understand<br/>
            The pain hidden inside my heart<br/>
            I am afraid, to use sincerity to face this world<br/>
            so I become more and more silent<br/><br/>
            
            One person(One person), floats in the huge crowd<br/>
            Cannot find anyone to talk<br/>
            Who can give me a gentle (hug me) hug<br/>
            When I feel that my heart will soon break to pieces<br/><br/>
            
            Angel Angel<br/>
            Wish that you are by my side<br/>
            Angel Angel<br/>
            Can you hear me summoning you<br/><br/>
            
            Can you tell a lonely and exhusted me<br/>
            You will forever wait for me<br/><br/>
            
            Angel Angel<br/>
            (Please) stay by my side<br/>
            Angel Angel<br/>
            (Please) don't let go my hand<br/>
