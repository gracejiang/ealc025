          <p>
            “Men’s Talk” is about a woman who sings her frustration at her lover
            for not opening up with her but instead discussing with his male
            friends. This indirect commentary alludes to the current exclusion
            of women from traditionally masucline spheres, such as business and
            politics. In these political songs, due to the beidong 被动
            (passive) and vulnerable portrayals of women, the woman often
            represents the “powerless people” whereas the man often represents
            the “oppressive government”, allowing men to further identity with
            the feminine voices. Thus, Mandopop’s gender portrayals are
            remarkably nuanced in that while they reinforce conservative gender
            roles, they also subvert then by allowing both men and women to
            identify with the women, allowing for women’s roles to become more
            relatable and appreciated by both genders and a different
            perspective for male listeners.

            “Because of you, I am blown by a cold wind” is told from a female
            perspective and conveys a deep sense of despair and disillusionment
            with her lover. The woman in this song is depicted with
            stereotypical “female” passivity, as noted through her actions of
            crying, waiting, and forgetting – “the tars run from my eyes”. The
            “cold wind” is a metaphor for the emotional coldness of her man,
            alluding to how Taiwanese men can emotionally withdraw from their
            relationships, leaving their partner waiting for them. The woman’s
            anger is expressed through her rejection of new suitors and
            condemnation of her friends for not sympathizing her pain, but also
            with an undertone of resignation – “who really cares about
            another?”. Additionally, her tone has underlying hints of
            forgiveness and a hope to “put things in the past.”

            “How can it be?” also conveys heartbreak and despair, but in a much
            more “masculine” manner. The singer’s anger is much more clearly
            expressed through singing in louder, indignant tones. Lyrically, the
            song speaks of love “crushing (fensui)” and chasing his lover,
            combined with the themes of unrestrained passion instead of
            resignation. Instead of accepting their relationship’s fate, the
            singer takes on a much more aggressive and angry tone. Although
            these two songs are written by the same lyricist Jonathan Lee, the
            expressions, musicality, and lyrics of the songs demonstrate a clear
            difference between the “natural characteristics” of men and women.

            “Angel” demonstrates the wenrou 温柔 aspect of Taiwanese
            masculinity. Tao expresses feelings of loneliness and an inability
            to express his feelings towards others, but still is able to convey
            his gentle side: “Who can give me wenrou and embrace me…?”. This
            multi-dimensional aspect on masculinity allows for men to be
            depicted with a wider range of emotional depth, although not as much
            as their women counterparts.
