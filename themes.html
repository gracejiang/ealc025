          Mandopop serves as a form of emotional expression for many Chinese and
          Taiwanese people. Due to a variety of factors, such as rapid
          modernization and urbanization, Eastern cultural norms of enduring
          hardships alone, and a conflicting shift towards individualism, many
          Chinese and Taiwanese people are experiencing higher rates of
          loneliness and other negative emotions without a proper avenue of
          expression. Over 12.3% of the population living in the urban cities of
          Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taizhong, which accounts for over 10.7 million
          people, reported feeling a sense of loneliness and emptiness in 2006
          (Jiang 2006).

          Urbanization is one reason for rising rates of loneliness in Taiwan.
          Unlike older generations where small-town alliances provided an
          immersive social experience, an increasing number of Taiwanese youth
          are experiencing urbanized city life, where a normal daily routine is
          to go to work alone and come back home alone. Additionally, Western
          and Eastern ideologies differ on the perspective of individualism.
          Western cultures tend to place a stronger emphasis on the individual,
          making it normal to separate from friends or family to pursue career
          or personal interests. On the other hand, familial and social ties are
          prioritized in Taiwanese and Chinese culture, making loneliness feel
          unnatural and even more isolating. Although Taiwan is increasingly
          shifting towards individualism, the societal norms and emotions that
          come with it have not yet naturalized within the culture.

          These increasingly common emotions of loneliness, emptiness, and
          sorrow are rare to discuss in the PRC and Taiwan due to prevalent
          cultural norms that idealize rennai 忍耐 (endurance of hardship) and
          social harmony, making it difficult for individuals to express
          themselves. Because of this, many individuals gravitate towards
          listening to songs that talk about these feelings of sadness instead.
          This provides them with a sense of solidarity, comforting them by
          reminding them that their experiences are shared and understood by
          others.

          Themes of loneliness and heartbreak are central to Mandopop. In 2009,
          the top 20 selling CDs in Taiwan contained over 80 keywords of
          loneliness or isolation from 227 songs, compared to the United States,
          where there were only 17 appearances of these keywords in the 306
          songs examined. Additionally, loneliness and heartbreak appear as
          central themes in Taiwanese music instead of passing references like
          they are in Western music. Stafanie Sun, a Singaporean performer and
          2004 Golden Melody Winner for Best Mandarin Female Singer, comments on
          the popularity of these emotions in Mandopop: “One reason [loneliness]
          is such an important theme in Mandopop is that it covers such a wide
          range of emotions and experiences... Mandopop songs are very sensitive
          to this range of experiences and because everyone has gone through
          these experiences a lot of people can relate to these songs” (Sun
          2005).

          In addition to listening to music as a form of expression, many
          Taiwanese and Chinese folks also enjoyed singing songs that resonated
          with them at Karaoke TV. The rise of Karaoke TV in the 1970’s shifted
          the enjoyment of music from public venues into private rooms and
          spaces. This allowed Taiwanese folks to sing amongst friends, creating
          a deeper sense of intimacy between groups. Because it is widely
          accepted that people in the PRC and Taiwan are generally less direct
          than their Western counterparts and that people do not directly
          express their emotions with others, Karaoke TV is an outlet for people
          to express their feelings while still adhering to social boundaries.
          The hardships that many people find hard to discuss in everyday
          conversation are then much easier expressed through singing lyrical
          music to reveal what she or he is feeling instead, with song choices
          indicating not only the person’s musical taste but also reflecting a
          public statement about their innermost feelings. In fact, it is quite
          common for women to break into tears while performing their favorite
          sad songs during Karaoke TV. In short, Karaoke TV became an
          increasingly popular way for individuals to indirectly express their
          emotions and share their experiences with others while still avoiding
          improper displays.
