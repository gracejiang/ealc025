          In addition to allowing individuals a socially-acceptable freedom of
          expression, Karaoke TV also gives them an opportunity to try on new
          identities and play with new roles. Karaoke TV blurs the boundaries
          between an idol and everyday person, allowing the average person to
          play out their gendered identities. In particular, a common theme in
          Karaoke TV is for women to act as performers for male pleasure, which
          was a traditional expectation in the 1900s for Taiwanese courtesans to
          entertain their guests with song and dance. On average, women play a
          central role in Karaoke TV performances by putting in more effort to
          prepare for their performances and singing more frequently than their
          male counterparts do.

          The theme of women performing is actually central to Mandopop, where
          it is common for men to be lyricists and for women to be singers.
          These male lyricists write songs for women to sing that complain about
          men and are often taken to be a real reflection of actual women’s
          experiences, regardless of the gender of the songwriter. While this
          may appear problematic at first glance, many women actually embrace
          this male lyricist and female performer dynamic and see their
          song-writing as a male contribution to the real desires, emotions, and
          experiences of women. The dynamic of male lyricists writing gendered
          stories and women audience members claiming these stories as their own
          experiences is thus widely accepted by Taiwanese and PRC women. In
          fact, many of the lyrics written by men are interpreted as “sisterly
          advice” for the female audience, despite the audience knowing the
          lyricist is male. Angel, a Taiwanese marketing executive, describes
          this trend: “Sometimes men behave badly but they know it. That’s why
          they can write songs from a woman’s perspective – because they also
          know right from wrong – they know that they’ve done something bad so
          they express it by writing these songs.” Both genders alike
          conceptualize Mandopop lyrics to be accurate representation of the
          experiences of people shared in the real world.

          Oftentimes, Mandopop lyrics represent the hopes and dreams of
          Taiwanese and PRC listeners. This is especially true for Taiwanese
          youth, one of Mandopop’s most prevalent audience groups. Taiwanese
          youth are heavily influenced by the lyrics of the music they listen to
          conceptualize what “real relationships” look like as well as to define
          their own gender identities. This is partially due to the fact that
          there are traditional sanctions against teenage dating, but also peer
          pressure and expectations to still do so. These sanctions make it so
          that Taiwanese youth cannot seek love and relationship advice from
          their parents or teachers, causing them to turn towards Mandopop
          instead. In fact, Taiwanese teens have nearly identical opinions with
          popular Mandopop lyrics concerning love, relationships, and the
          “natural” tendencies of each gender, even before having their own
          experiences.

          The portrayals of men and women in Mandopop take on a more traditional
          perspective, with women being characterized as more “emotional” and
          men being characterized as more “intellectual.” Women are yin and
          generally are portrayed as emotional, yilai 依赖 (dependent) on men,
          innocent and pure, renci 仁慈 (kind and forgiving), beidong 被动
          (passive), and wenrou 温柔 (gentle, tender, and feminine). On the
          other hand, men are yang and are portrayed as xinchangyaoying 心肠要赢
          (hard-hearted), zili 资历 (independent), but also titie 体贴
          (considerate), wenrou 温柔, renci 仁慈, and baorong 包容 (tolerate) as
          well. The contradiction of depictions for each gender, such as men
          being both hard-hearted and tender, illustrate the flexibility of
          gender-constructed concepts in Mandopop. These gender differences are
          legitimated through the “Western science” and are a not specific to
          Mandopop, but rather a reflection of pre-existing cultural conceptions
          from cinema, literature, and other mass media of both Taiwan/the PRC
          and Western countries. Men are characterized as active in doing what
          they want for their own reasons (piaobo 漂泊), while women are
          characterized as stationary and waiting. This generalization
          originated between 1949 and 1988 during which men left their villages
          to find better employment opportunities in cities and women stayed
          behind to raise the family and wait for their husbands’ return.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the depiction of masculine identity in Mandopop is more
          complex than just hard-heartedness; it is also common for men to take
          on a more androgynous character through showing the traits of titie
          体贴 (considerate), wenrou 温柔 (gentle, tender), and baorong 包容
          (caring). While these traits are more stereotypically “feminine”, they
          are actually seen as an ideal in men within Taiwanese culture. Being
          wenrou 温柔 is not stigmatized in Taiwan as it is in more Western
          societies because it demonstrates “an ideal for caring men that make
          up for the men in women’s real-life relationships” (Maskowitz 2010,
          p.89). While American standards of masculinity are often muscular men,
          in Taiwan, overly muscular bodies are often associated with
          lower-class working men, gay culture, or criminals and gangsters. This
          androgyny of men creates a multidimensional depiction of what a
          masucline identity really is, defying typical Western standards of
          masculinity.

          Mandopop gender stereotypes are widely accepted by both men and women
          alike, with both genders embracing their portrayals in their lyrics.
          While these traditional portrayals may be problematic in some aspects,
          such as reinforcing gender stereotypes, they also are progressive in
          other aspects, such as the humanization of women. One demonstration of
          this is that Mandopop has a heavy emphasis on the feelings and stories
          of women, which is much more liberal compared to older styles of
          Chinese and Taiwanese music. For example, the PRC’s 1930 jazz movement
          cast women as hypersexual vixens that use their sexual duplicity to
          cheat men. Women are nothing more than secondary objects in these old
          portrayals, in comparison to the fully human and emotional portrayals
          in modern Mandopop that generally stray away from sexual themes. While
          modern Mandopop casts women in “secondary roles”, they are often seen
          as more humane and wenrou 温柔 than their male counterparts, often
          portrayed as “victims” to the man. These characterizations give voice
          to the hardships that many women in Taiwan and the PRC face in their
          day-to-day relationships. Taiwanese women enjoy how they are depicted
          as “angelic martyrs” and all the soft stereotypes, such as being
          wenrou 温柔, beidong 被动, and renci 仁慈, since it makes the women in
          the songs more relatable and innocent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relatability of women singers extends beyond just female
          audiences; male listeners also show appreciation and identify with the
          wenrou 温柔 aspect of women’s songs. Political songs in Mandopop often
          do not directly talk about controversial issues and instead allude to
          them through the dynamics of a man and woman relationship. One example
          is “Men’s Talk”, which is about a woman who sings her frustration at
          her lover for not opening up with her but instead discussing with his
          male friends. This indirect commentary alludes to the current
          exclusion of women from traditionally masucline spheres, such as
          business and politics. In these political songs, due to the beidong
          被动 (passive) and vulnerable portrayals of women, the woman often
          represents the “powerless people” whereas the man often represents the
          “oppressive government”, allowing men to further identity with the
          feminine voices. Thus, Mandopop’s gender portrayals are remarkably
          nuanced in that while they reinforce conservative gender roles, they
          also subvert then by allowing both men and women to identify with the
          women, allowing for women’s roles to become more relatable and
          appreciated by both genders and a different perspective for male
          listeners.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, while Mandopop lyrics can carry some problematic gender
          stereotypes, they also are progressive in humanizing women’s
          experiences and stories and portraying a wider-range of emotional
          depth to men.
