                你說你有個朋友　
                住在淡水河邊　
                相識在你最沮喪的那一年
                直到我的出現　
                你才滿心快樂
                把我們的事對他說了又說　
                不像平常那樣的沈默

                愛人不能是朋友嗎　
                你怎麼都不回答　
                你的心事為什麼只能告訴他
                我其實也想知道　
                你有多麼喜歡我　
                你怎麼跟別人形容我

                後來我才知道　
                有些話你只對朋友說
                你們叫它做
                淡水河邊的MEN'S TALK

                後來我才明白　
                有些事你只對朋友說
                我和你　就像天和地　
                你是雲　天上飛　
                而我的淚水滴成了河

                愛人不能是朋友嗎

            You said you have a friend　
            Living by the Danshui River　
            Acquaintance in your most frustrated year
            Until my appearance　
            You are happy
            I told him about our affairs and said 　
            Not as silent as usual

            Can't the lover be a friend?
            Why don't you answer 　
            Why can you only tell him about your thoughts
            I actually want to know 　
            How do you like me　
            How do you describe me to others

            I didn't know until later 　
            There are some things you only tell your friends
            You call it to do
            MEN'S TALK by the Tamsui River

            Later I understood 　
            Some things you only tell your friends
            I and you are like heaven and earth 　
            You are the cloud 　 Flying in the sky
            And my tears became a river
