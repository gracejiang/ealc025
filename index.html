            <p>Mandopop is an up and rising genre of pop music, encompassing any Mandarin Chinese-language songs. This
                paper introduces the background of Mandopop, explores the emotional and cultural themes behind Mandopop,
                and
                examines the influence of Mandopop on the construction of gender identity in Taiwan and the People’s
                Republic of China (PRC).</p>
            <p>Mandopop in the PRC is largely dominated by Gang-tai pop, or popular music originating in Taiwan or Hong
                Kong. Taiwanese pop culture and music has made a remarkable impact on the PRC in a trend known as
                “Taiwan’s counter-invasion of China”, with Taiwanese Mandopop being one of the most popular music genres
                in the
                PRC, over traditional Chinese folk music, Chinese jazz, and other PRC created music. From 2002 to today,
                Gang-tai pop has consistently accounted for a staggering 80% of Chinese-language music sales in the PRC
                (Moskowitz 2010), which is an astounding statistic considering that Taiwan is home to only around 23.5
                million
                people, compared to the 1.4 billion people living in the PRC. One of the main reasons for Gang-tai pop’s
                massive
                success in the PRC is due to the fact that music companies from Taiwan and Hong Kong have much more
                experience in the entertainment industry and what the market demands, following strategies from larger
                Korean entertainment companies. Additionally, Taiwanese music benefits from integrating a diverse range
                of
                cultural styles, creating a transnational blend of traditional Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, and Western
                musical ethos. This is partially due to the fact that Taiwan was exposed to the Japanese musical form
                enka
                during their colonial history under Japanese rule between 1895 and 1945. Finally, a large reason for
                Gang-tai pop’s success over PRC music is that the PRC eliminated all but a very select few political
                songs
                between 1949 and 1978, stifling musical creativity and expression within the PRC. All these factors
                contributed to a massive success of Gang-tai pop throughout both Taiwan and the PRC.
            <p>While Mandopop lyrics may seem superficial at first glance, they are surprisingly deep and progressive in
                terms of challenging traditional norms. Mandopop provides a space to discuss human emotions, especially
                those of loneliness and sorrow, which are traditionally discouraged in Taiwanese and Chinese culture.
                Additionally, Mandopop explores many complex themes, such as the characterization of gender roles and
                identities in Taiwan, the breakdown of traditional values, and an increasing expression of individualist
                ideologies.
