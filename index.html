          Mandopop is an up and rising genre of pop music, encompassing any
          Mandarin Chinese-language songs. This website introduces the
          background of Mandopop, explores the emotional and cultural themes
          behind Mandopop, and examines the influence of Mandopop on the
          construction of gender identity in Taiwan and the People’s Republic of
          China (PRC).

          Mandopop in the PRC is largely dominated by Gang-tai pop, or popular
          music originating in Taiwan or Hong Kong. Taiwanese pop culture and
          music has made a remarkable impact on the PRC in a trend known as
          “Taiwan’s counter-invasion of China”, with Taiwanese Mandopop being
          one of the most popular music genres in the PRC, over traditional
          Chinese folk music, Chinese jazz, and other PRC created music. From
          2002 to today, Gang-tai pop has consistently accounted for a
          staggering 80% of Chinese-language music sales in the PRC (Moskowitz
          2010), which is an astounding statistic considering that Taiwan is
          home to only around 23.5 million people, compared to the 1.4 billion
          people living in the PRC. One of the main reasons for Gang-tai pop’s
          massive success in the PRC is due to the fact that music companies
          from Taiwan and Hong Kong have much more experience in the
          entertainment industry and what the market demands, following
          strategies from larger Korean entertainment companies. Additionally,
          Taiwanese music benefits from integrating a diverse range of cultural
          styles, creating a transnational blend of traditional Chinese,
          Japanese, Taiwanese, and Western musical ethos. This is partially due
          to the fact that Taiwan was exposed to the Japanese musical form enka
          during their colonial history under Japanese rule between 1895 and
          1945. Finally, a large reason for Gang-tai pop’s success over PRC
          music is that the PRC eliminated all but a very select few political
          songs between 1949 and 1978, stifling musical creativity and
          expression within the PRC. All these factors contributed to a massive
          success of Gang-tai pop throughout both Taiwan and the PRC.

          While Mandopop lyrics may seem superficial at first glance, they are
          surprisingly deep and progressive in terms of challenging traditional
          norms. Mandopop provides a space to discuss human emotions, especially
          those of loneliness and sorrow, which are traditionally discouraged in
          Taiwanese and Chinese culture. Additionally, Mandopop explores many
          complex themes, such as the characterization of gender roles and
          identities in Taiwan, the breakdown of traditional values, and an
          increasing expression of individualist ideologies.
